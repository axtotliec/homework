# homework


## Could you help me?
I would like to make a query similar to:

```
www.mydomain.com/App1/NameTable/?order=random&limit=20&format=json
```


### I would like to implement a random function similar to this script, you did it with "OrderingFilter":
https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/master/wagtail/api/v2/filters.py

### My homework:
*  List all the data in a table and filter by course and asset **(I already did)**. ðŸ˜€
*  List a certain amount of data from the same table and randomly **(my problem)**. ðŸ˜­
